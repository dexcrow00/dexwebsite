<!-- Template for adding new blog posts -->
<!-- Copy this structure and paste it into posts.html where you want to add a new post -->

<div class="post-card">
    <h2 class="post-title">Your Post Title Here</h2>
    <div class="post-meta">Published on [Date]</div>
    <p class="post-excerpt">
        Your post excerpt goes here. This should be a brief summary of what the post is about.
        Keep it to about 2-3 sentences to give readers a good idea of the content.
    </p>
    <a href="#" class="read-more">Read More</a>
</div>

<!-- 
To add a new post:
1. Copy the above HTML structure
2. Paste it into posts.html in the posts-container div
3. Replace "Your Post Title Here" with your actual post title
4. Replace "[Date]" with the actual publication date
5. Replace the excerpt text with your post summary
6. Update the href="#" in the read-more link to point to the full post (if you create individual post pages)

You can also create individual post pages by:
1. Creating a new HTML file (e.g., post-1.html, post-2.html)
2. Using the same styling from posts.html
3. Adding the full post content
4. Updating the "Read More" links to point to these individual pages
